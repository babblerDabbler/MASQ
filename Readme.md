## 📌 Project Overview

**MASQ** is a free-to-play, browser-based PvP card game where players engage in on-chain battles using collectible NFT-like cards powered by the $MASQ token. It seamlessly blends strategy, lore, tokenomics, and immersive visuals into a Web3-native gaming experience.

---

## 🔥 Core Features

- 🔗 On-chain multiplayer card duels  
- 💰 Native token ($MASQ) for staking, rewards, and pack purchases  
- 🧠 Dynamic deck system with draw/play/mana mechanics  
- 🔐 Integrated Supabase backend for authentication and user tracking  
- 🖥️ HTML/CSS/JS front-end with WebGL rendering (Three.js)  

---

## Vision and Philosophy

MASQuerades champions:

- 🎯 **Fair Play**: No presales or unfair advantages.  
- 🤝 **Community Ownership**: Majority of tokens go to the community.  
- 🧠 **Dynamic Strategy**: Combos, bluffing, and skillful play.  
- 🌐 **Decentralized Governance**: Players shape the game’s future.  
- 🤖 **AI Battles**: Play against Grok AI — the first of its kind.

---

## Gameplay Overview

Turn-based battles against Grok, AI opponent powered by xAPI. Cards have attack, health, and abilities. Mana grows each turn. Win by reducing your opponent’s health to zero.

### Combat Mechanics

- Draw and play cards  
- Spend mana  
- Attack and defend  
- Win by reducing opponent HP to 0

**Card Types**:

- **Attackers**: Deal damage  
- **Defenders**: Absorb damage  
- **Utility**: Control the game board  

### Field Placement & Strategy

Cards are placed strategically on the field to control tempo, defense lines, and combos. Decision-making on placement is as important as the card itself.

### Combo System

**Combos** are essential to high-level play:

- **Trigger Abilities**: Activate when played after certain cards  
- **Chain Effects**: Refund mana, draw more, or boost stats  
- **Adaptive Play**: Force reactive strategies

**Example Combo**:

1. `Mana Surge Initiator` – Boost mana this turn  
2. `Whispers of the Ancients` – Draw 2 cards if mana was boosted  
3. `Overload Blast` – Spend extra mana to deal massive damage

## Card Sets and Expansions

- **Core Set**: Balanced entry decks  
- **Golden Cards**: Rare and collectible; no ability but high status  
- **Expansions**: Future sets based on degen lore and meme culture
